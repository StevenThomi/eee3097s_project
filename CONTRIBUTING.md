# Contributing guidelines
We’d love you to help us improve this project. To help us keep this collection high quality, we request contributions to adhere to the following guidelines.

- **Provide a link to the application or project’s homepage.** Unless it’s extremely popular, there’s a chance the maintainers don’t know about or use the language, framework, editor, app, or project your change applies to.

- **Provide links to documentation supporting the change you’re making.** Current, canonical documentation mentioning the files being ignored is best. If documentation isn’t available to support your change, do the best you can to explain what the files being ignored are for.

- **Explain why you’re making a change.** Even if it seems self-evident, please take a sentence or two to tell us why your change or addition should happen. It’s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to everyone who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.

- **Please only modify one file per pull request.** This helps keep pull requests and feedback focused on a specific project or technology.

In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change you’re making, the more likely we’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.
