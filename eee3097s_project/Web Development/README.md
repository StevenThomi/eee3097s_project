## Web Application

The Web Application consists of four main parts:
- Flask Web Application
- HTML pages
- MariaDB database
- Apache web server

The **Flask Web Application** controls the flow of control, get and post requests and data transfer in the web application.

The **HTML pages** order the information parsed to them in order to convey a meaning to the user.

The **MariaDB database** stores the data fed to it via the Samba interfaced text file (data.txt).

The **Apache web server** provides an environment for phpMyAdmin to run and display the tables in a neat and orderly structure.
