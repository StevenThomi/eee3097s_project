<h2>Iot Application Sector And Value Potential</h2>
<p>
  The IoT application sector described by my target API and designs is in the area of Agriculture and Forestry.<br>
  Agriculture and Forestry is a vital scientific field that focuses on plants, animals, and the environments in which they thrive. The sector deals with forest restoration, managing natural resources, and food production.<br>
  Agriculture and Forestry spans the following fields, which are in turn related to trends in IoT as described:<br>
  <div>
  1) Conservation<br>
  Definition: It is the preservation, protection, or restoration of the natural environment and of wildlife<br>
  IoT: IoT devices and small microchips can be implanted on endangered wildlife i.e. rhinoceros, to keep track of their location, and as a result reduce poaching.<br><br>
  2) Water Management<br>
  Definition: It is the planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of water resources.<br>
  IoT: IoT devices can be fitted in water distribution systems and dams to ensure no leakage and keep track of the water level, and as a result enable more information collection on the availability and consumption of water
  as well as the integrity of the distribution system, which enables planning for optimum use of water resources i.e. through rationing.<br><br>
  3) Food Science<br>
  Definition: It is the study of the chemical and physical properties of foods and of changes that may occur during processing and storage.<br>
  IoT: IoT devices are used to regulate storage conditions i.e. temperature, humidity for foods using sensors, and as a result preserving the freshness of foods for longer.<br><br>
  4) Ecology<br>
  Definition: It is the branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings.<br>
  IoT: IoT devices and small microchips can be implanted on animals i.e. lions, to keep track of their location, and as a result study movement patterns and resources being
  searched for â€“ such technology comes in handy when doing decade long research on a fixed sample size.<br><br>
