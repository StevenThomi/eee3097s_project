The following fire marshall has been registered: 
UserID: 877, Name: , Phone: 0, Password: 0, Login Status: True, Station: FireStation.SOUTH

Let's change some of their attributes;
First of all, lets change their name. 
Input a cool name: Steve Thomi

A password of '0' doesn't sound so strong. 
Input a strong password: 1234

What about a phone number? It's always good to be accessible. 
Input a phone number: 0701071594

Looking good! Their account is now starting to take shape: 
UserID: 877, Name: Steve Thomi, Phone: 0701071594, Password: 1234, Login Status: True, Station: FireStation.SOUTH

One last thing, what about a fancier user ID 877 sounds a little bit bulky. 
Would you like to change it (Y/N)?Y
