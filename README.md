## Electrical and Computer Engineering Practical Design and Implementation course.

## Aim:
Using a small single-board computer, develop an IoT application to generate a temperature and humidity mapping of a wide geometrical location.

## Use Case:
The temperature and humidity mapping can be used in the following areas:
- identify location of forest fires, as well as velocity of travel of the flame
- identify potential desert locust breeding grounds through analysis of relative humidity

## Tools:
